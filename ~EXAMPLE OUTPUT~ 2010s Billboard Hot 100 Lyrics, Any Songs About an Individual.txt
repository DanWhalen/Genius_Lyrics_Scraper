[Verse 1]
I locked myself in a hotel room
Then waited all night for the walls to move
I've loved some girls that I barely knew
I've made some friends, and I've lost some too
Crashed my car, I was seventeen
My mother in the seat riding next to me
The things I've learned from a broken mirror
How a face can change when a heart knows fear
For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

[Chorus]
If I could fly
Then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe
I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Verse 2]
I've cafe crawled through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I've seen London, and I've played Japan
I've been knocked down, I got up again
For all the places I have been
I'm no place without you

[Chorus]
If I could fly
Then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe
I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Bridge]
For all the things my hands have held
The best by far is you

[Chorus]
If I could fly
Then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I'd keep you safe
I'd keep you dry
Don't be afraid, Cecilia
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky

[Outro]
And you're the sky
I'm the satellite
And you're the sky
And you're the sky

[Verse 1]
Tripping out, spinning around
I'm underground, I fell down
Yeah, I fell down
I'm freaking out, so where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop it now
It can't stop me now, oh

[Chorus]
I, I'll get by
I, I'll survive
When the world's crashing down, when I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around, don't you try to stop me
I, I won't cry

[Bridge]
I found myself (myself) in Wonderland
Get back on (back on) my feet again
Is this real? (this real) Is this pretend?
I'll take a stand (a stand) until the end

I, I'll get by

[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her "Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!"
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home

So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on-on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

For us not to make the bed squeak

Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing
(So amazing, so amazing)
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
Westside is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie, right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside

I ain't from Dallas but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now everybody tryna to do me
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryna to screw me
Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money

We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'

[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
We got this king-size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's Kama Sutra show and tell, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screaming, "Mercy, mercy, please!"
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor]
And when you leave me all alone
I'm like a stray without a home
I'm like a dog without a bone
I just want you for my own
I got to have you, babe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charlie Puth & Meghan Trainor]
Woah-oh-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd rather be in trouble with you

Ooh, baby, I got that healing that you want, yes

Until the dawn, let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Meghan Trainor]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want

You've got to give it up to me

Look up here, I'm in heaven

[Intro: Ericka Lee on the phone]
Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious…

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say…

[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."

[Interlude: Drake]
You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We gonna be in some trouble, trouble

Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 2]
Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard
And think Jeff Tweedy is one bad mother
Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
One day you'll lead the charge, you'll lead the band
Guitar Hero with lightnin' hands
And the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
They'll be helpless to your musical charms
And they'll all hold up their hands
They'll all wanna dance

[Verse 3]
First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
She was hotter than the Devil's hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers
Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions
So he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
Had an axe to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 4]
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
They tried to file my points, sand my edges
And I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, I'm Mr. Misunderstood

[Chorus]
They're standing in line, chasing the buzz
Til the next big things and already was
And hell if they know what they're trying to find
If it ain't that same old, been-done kind
Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed
I'm Mr. Misunderstood, Mr. Misunderstood

[Verse 5]
Hey there, weird kid in your high-top shoes
Sitting in the back of the class; I was just like you
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)
Mr. Misunderstood (I understand)

[Verse]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
"I'm on Fire" and "Born to Run"
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Ooohh

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name
I bet there'd still be a spark

Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath

[Verse 1: Camila & Lauren]
I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying good-bye
My eyes are finally dry
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me, but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lauren & Dinah & (Normani)]
I broke the glass that surrounded me (surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side, (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrified)
Now I'm now longer afraid
It's Independence Day
(It's Independence Day)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh

Everything is changing
And I never want to go back
To the way it was (the way it was)
I'm finding out who I am and who I am
From here on out is gonna be enough (gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough...

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls
I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you... meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreaming
When you said you loved me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Me too
I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you
Dreaming of you
I've been dreaming
Dreaming

Yeah, I know he's been a good friend of mine

Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine

And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with the charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl

[Verse 1]
I just want a Picasso in my casa, no, my castle
I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I wanna Rothko, no, I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling
All for the love of drug dealing
Marble floors, gold ceilings
Oh, what a feeling, fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit Blue, you own it

They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, "Old man, just stop"
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon take for me to go
For you to see, I'm the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby

Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know

And this child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?

That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know

When you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?

Oh, Mary, did you know

Ooh

Oh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Chorus]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Aw yeah, fuck the judge, I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

[Chorus 2]
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'—{Gunshot}
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—{Gunshot}
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
(Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)

[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the prez with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)

Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want? You a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché, then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]

We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

What up, how is everyone doing?
You are now in the world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wonderous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some Generation-Next shit
Speak for the seller who I left with
Parallel levels in the dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words
These are facts from a winner

You can see past if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wonderous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, fitted it into the T
Work hard, makin' sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ay
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side

Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
Them basic bitches wear that shit, so I don't even bother
I put that on my partner, I put that on my family
Oakland city represent, address me as your majesty
Yeah you can kiss the ring, but you can never touch the crown
I smoke a million Swisher blunts and I ain't never coming down
Bitch, you ain't no Barbie, I see you work at Arby's
Number 2, super-sized, hurry up I'm starving
Gnarly, radical, on the block I'm magical
See me at your college campus baggie full of Adderalls
Call me if you need a fix, call me if you need a boost
See them other chickenheads? They don't never leave the coop
I'm in the coupe cruising, I got the stolen plates
Serving all the fiends over there by the Golden Gate
Bridge, I'm colder than the fridge and the freezer
I'm snatching all your bitches at my leisure

Trump, you know I keep that work in my trunk
Got my hand on the pump if you wanna press your luck
I'm yelling "Free V-Nasty" 'til my throat is raspy
Young, rich and flashy I be where the cash be
You can't find that? I think you need a Google Map
My pearl-handled kitty-cat will leave and press your noodle back
Now Google that groupies follow me like Twitter
I'm rolling up my catnip and shitting in your litter
Why you looking bitter? I be looking better
The type of bitch that make you wish that you ain't never met her
The editor, director plus I'm my own boss
So posh, nails fierce with the gold gloss
Which means nobody getting over me
I got the swag and it's pumping out my ovaries

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

[Interlude]
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

[Outro]
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, *chuckles*
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands

Smoke that Kiesha, not that Reggie
For you name dropping niggas
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say "Bad Bitches Only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go pew
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah all my niggas nuts and I'm a loose screw
Bitch I get big bucks, pockets on Bruce Bruce

Welcome to The Murder Show — I am the motherfucking host

Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I don't fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the diamond face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers "Bombs away"

This man is kinda high over here

Ayo, the flyest motherfucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public
And you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

And motherfuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Verse 3: Mary J Blige]
Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
"Don't do it, Mary!"
I guess they never had none

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)

Ain't no way that I’m moving on

[Bridge: Mary J Blige]
When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on
I love my Mr. Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can’t help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says she is the one
She says I am the one

Where is Mrs. Right? I gotta see her

Get me on a flight, I gotta see her
Travel all across the world just to meet her

From the Chi-Town, yo she might be out the states
Book a flight to London, ook a flight to France
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?

MB on your ringtone, posters in your room
Sassy lil' thang, li-like the way ya talk
Heard ya got the goods gon head show 'em off
Take a picture quick, send it to my phone
Dimple in your cheek, white gucci stunnas on
Don’t know where you’ve been hidin from me so long

All my German chicks, let me kiss ya back

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch!
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask "Why not?")

The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?

Manning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!

[Verse 4: Eminem as Slim Shady]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass

It's (high class) meets (white trash)

Not ten on the back, I need ten on signin'
Give that shit to a washed up bitch, I’m winnin’

Take bitches to school, then I Columbine these hoes
I hear the slick shit, bitch, you washed
All you hoes cryin’—Christopher Bosh

Raggedy Ann could never be a Barbie, bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel scrapin’

My ex wanna work it out, bitch, try yoga
Two hoes in the bed, tell them hoes slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi

[Verse 1: Niall]
Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'll be leaving you
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out

[Verse 1]
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

Whoa, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

[Intro: LOLO]
Climbing out the back door, didn't leave a mark
No one knows it's you, Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

[Verse 1: Brendon Urie]
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky
Kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud
A face like heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Brendon Urie]
Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn
But I love her anyway
I love her anyway, I love her anyway

Oh, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh, out the back door, goddamn

Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger
Watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (tragic in the fall out)

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn

Standing there alone
The ship is waiting
All systems are go
Are you sure?
Control is not convinced
But the computer
Has the evidence
"No need to abort"
The countdown starts

Watching in a trance
The crew is certain
Nothing left to chance
All is working
Trying to relax
Up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink"
Jokes Major Tom
The count goes on

4 3 2 1
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating, weightless
Calling, calling home...

Second stage is cut
We're now in orbit
Stabilizers up
Running perfect
Starting to collect
Requested data
"What will it effect
When all is done?"
Thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control
There is a problem
Go to rockets full
Not responding
"Hello, Major Tom
Are you receiving?
Turn the thrusters on
We're standing by"
There's no reply

4 3 2 1
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating, weightless
Calling, calling home...

Across the stratosphere
A final message
"Give my wife my love"
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship
The world is mourning
They don't realize
He's alive
No one understands
But Major Tom sees
Now the life commands
This is my home
I'm coming home

Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating, weightless
Calling home...
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating, weightless
Calling home...
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating, weightless
Calling, calling home...
Home.....

[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda' known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda' known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

[Outro]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda' known
You shoulda' known
Don't you think I was too young
You shoulda' known

(Raleigh! What it is? What up John?)

[Hook]
Raleigh be the city where we like to do the dance
Flex to the left throw some money out ya hands
We do it for the city, and
We do it for the fans
But to ball like Wall
Boy you gotta do the dance

Everybody do the John Wall, John Wall
John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall
John Wall, John Wall

[Verse 1: Breeze]
Everybody clear out, hand me the rock
Time winding down 3 seconds on the shot clock
Break the defense homeboy, I can't be stopped
All about my money so you know I'm hitting bank shots
I'm trying to tell them, boy you can't guard this
Beast on the court homeboy I play the hardest
Jump shot stupid; yeah it's retarded
You can't guard me in the paint I'm an artist
See I hustle on the floor call me Rick Ross
See the Troop get it jumping like a tip-off
I play hard until I hear the ref blow the whistle
I'm a player but my game be so official
Never reach got to stay out of foul trouble
But I drive in the lane, get them in foul trouble
They can't solve my game; I'm a hard puzzle
But I keep three dimes - that's a triple double

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Lil Inferno]
Sick with it
Hustle for the rock I go-go get it
I'm in it to win it, 919 baby we represent it
And I don't ball hog we got our whole team in it
See you just dribble but ain't ever got the heart to finish
Can't put me out the game I'm in that thing from start to finish
And if I can't drive the lane then best believe I'm about to dish it
Sideline drifting now, I'm gliding down the baseline
About to do a big slam catch me on them inches
Coming from the south side
The expectations of us is that we will not rise
And still we prove them wrong, we flexing cause we hot guys
Bring life to the game we will not die
Ha, yeah
Stand tall, yeah you call that the great Wall
All I do is ball I get up I can take a fall
I'm hungry for the top, call it lunchtime
Game winning shot, yeah it's clutch time

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Lil Lee]
(Let's do it)
Oh yeah we balling, balling until we falling
Until the last second I'm guessing we gone be brawling
Cause Kentucky here to win, not to watch you play
Whole world do the dance, say what up UK
Better take him out the game, cause they say that boy insane
When he coming down the lane, trying to catch a bang bang
First we flex, show the muscle then jigg on them
For the small play, let DeMarcus Cousins get big on them
You ain't handling nothing I'm about to catch a steal on them
Pass it to the point, crossover and I'm still on them
Crowd going bananas so you know that's why we peel on them
And we from the "R", ain't nothing like being real on them
Jump shot deadly, you know that we kill on them
Time to grab the money ball, about to shoot a bill on them
Yeah, North Cal. we gonna show them how to do it
Do the John Wall it ain't really nothing to it

Got the Halloween kicks, trick-or-treating the clutch
C'mon nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow, flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me "Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?"
As-Salamlu alaykum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I've done penny nickel dimed, I done coined the phrase, ha!
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Lear
Indian-style, courtside with a cavalier

I've been burning bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man has had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

[Chorus 1]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while
Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie

[Verse 2]
Sweet Annie
I know I promised you life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I pray it's not too late

[Chorus 2]

Can I stay with you a while
Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy

And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be

Turn out the light
These hands are made to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again
